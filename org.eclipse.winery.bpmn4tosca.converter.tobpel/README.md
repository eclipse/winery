# BPMN4TOSCA2BPEL
Converter for transforming a BPMN4TOSCA management process to a TOSCA BPEL management process

## Code Style
We loosely follow [Google's Style Guide]()https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
We especially follow the [CamelCaseRule](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.3-camel-case):
`BPMN4TOSCA2BPEL` is wrong, `Bpmn4Tosca2Bpel` is correct.

## IDE
Use IntelliJ as Eclipse has issues with `trim_trailing_whitespace = true`.
