This presents the tool chain used for creating and updating a pull request on GitHub.

For the general setup, please go to [Eclipse Winery Toolchain](toolchain.md).


## Steps for working on a topic

Main idea: Separate  branch for each topic (fix a bug, add functionality) and accordingly named.
See <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html> for more information.

  1. Sync with latest changes on upstream (especially master branch): `git fetch upstream --prune`.
  3. Create branch based on `upstream/master` and make it known publicly:
     - `git checkout upstream/master`
     - `git checkout -b [name]`  
        Branch naming patterns:
          - Bugfix: `fix/SHORT-TITLE`, e.g., `fix/deletion-of-namespaces`
          - Feature: `feature/SHORT-TITLE`, e.g., `feature/drag-and-drop-for-bpmn4tosca`
          - Thesis: `thesis/SHORT-THESIS-TITLE`. Replace `SHORT-THESIS-TITLE` with something meaningful, e.g., `thesis/versioning`
          - EnPro: prefix `fix` or `feature` (see above) with `enpro/`, e.g., `enpro/fix/policy-rendering`
          - StuPro: prefix `fix` or `feature` (see below) with `stupro/`, e.g., `stupro/feature/github-oauth`
     - `git push --set-upstream origin [name]`
  4. Do you your fist commit. Don't forget to sign-off the commit (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in Git Gui).
  6. Push the changes to origin: `git push`.
  7. Create [WIP] Pull Request.
     - Go to <https://github.com/opentosca/winery> ðŸ¡’ Pull Request
     - Change the "base branch" to OpenTOSCA/winery
       ![](figures/ChangeBaseForkToOpentoscaWinery.png)
     - Fill in the title of the Pull Request following the pattern `[WIP] Title of the thesis/work/target`
     - Fill in the provided description form
     - Add `[x]` to the items listed in the write field
     - Check the description in the Preview and send the Pull Request
  8. There are automatic checks in place
     ![](figures/AutoCheckGit.png)
  9. If there is a red cross, click in respective "Details" and fix them

**You keep working and discuss with your supervisor how things go.**

After each working day, do the following:
    
  1. Commit. Don't forget to sign the commit (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in Git Gui).
  2. `git push`
  3. Keep your branch updated with `upstream/master`:
     - `git fetch upstream`
     - `git merge upstream/master`
     - Resolve conflicts - if there are some. See <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/resolving-conflicts.html> for a documentation when using IntellIJ.
     - `git push`


## GitHub - Prepare Final Pull Request

The aim of these steps to have a **single commit**.
This is required by the Eclipse process for checking for intellectual property (IP process for short).

**Before commencing these steps, check with your supervisor**

### Formal Requirements

* <http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git> ðŸ¡’ Create an account **WITH THE SAME EMAIL AS USED FOR THE COMMITS** (can also be checked in [gitk])
* Sign the Contributor Agreement electronically

### Git Steps: Ensure that a single commit is created

  1. `git fetch upstream` - fetches all updates from https://github.com/eclipse/winery ("upstream") to the local git storage
  2. `git merge upstream/master` - merges all updates from upstream to the local branch
  3. (Resolve merge conflicts) - required if there are conflicting changes
  4. Commit & Push with signed commit message (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in Git Gui) - this ensures that you have the changes backuped in case something goes wrong at the next steps 
  5. `git reset upstream/master` - this prepares that all commits can be squashed together:
     The local checkout ("working tree") is left untouched, but the "pointer" of the current branch is reset to `upstream/master`.
     Now, Git Gui shows the difference between `upstream/master` and your changes.
  6. Check changes in Git Gui:
     - Each change you wanted: Is it recognized?
     - At each file: Is the copyright information in the [header](source-code-headers.md) OK?
     - Check if you are listed in the [NOTICE](https://github.com/eclipse/winery/blob/master/NOTICE) file as a contributor with the correct year
     - Are there too much changed lines? ðŸ¡’ Do not stage spurious lines to the commit (e.g., tab to spaces, ...)
     - Are there too much changed files? ðŸ¡’ Do not stage files you did not intend to change (e.g., `build.gradle` if you did not touch `build.gradle` at all)
     - Check again the style (!)
     - (Don't forget RESCAN to see the current changes)
  7. Add description as new markdown file to to `docs/index.md` (if helpful)
  8. Press "Stage to Commit" ðŸ¡’ all changes are staged to Commit
  9. Sign the Commit Message (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in Git Gui)
  10. In the case of multiple authors: Add each additional author with `Co-authored-by`.
      See also in the [Eclipse Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit).  
      Example:
      ```
      Co-authored-by: Some Bodyelse <somebodyelse@nowhere.com>
      Signed-off-by: Some Body <somebody@somewhere.com>
      ```
  11. Commit & Push with "force overwrite" since you changed the branch: `git push -f`


## GitHub - Create Final Pull Request

**Attention: Commits on the same branch done after the Pull Request is sent are still part of the Pull Request (!)**

* Go to https://github.com/eclipse/winery ðŸ¡’ Pull Request
* Fill in the title of the Pull Request and give a more detailed description of the changes or added functionality
* In case of UI changes: Add screenshots
* Add `[x]` to the items listed in the write field
* Check the description in the Preview and send the Pull Request
* Close your Pull Request at OpenTOSCA/winery with a comment referencing the full URL of the new Pull Request, e.g. `Follow up at https://github.com/eclipse/winery/pull/212`.


## GitHub - Change Final Pull Request

* There are automatic checks in place
  ![](figures/AutoCheckGit.png)

* If there is a red cross, click in respective "Details" and fix them

* In case of missing code quality, ... changes are requested by a committer (person controlling the pull request process)
* FOR WINERY THE FOLLOWING APPLIES:
  - Open Git Gui
  - Make requested changes in your code (don't forget to RESCAN)
  - Commit
  - Push
  - Wait for a second review
  - In case everything is fine, squash the commits into one.
    See [GitHub - Prepare Pull Request](#github---prepare-pull-request).
    Then, do a force push (`git push -f`).


## GitHub - After Pull Request Got Merged

* Delete the branch locally.
* The branch on origin (<https://github.com/OpenTOSCA/winery>) is deleted by the maintainer having done the merge.
