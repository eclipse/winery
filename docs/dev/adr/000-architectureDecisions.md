# Winery Architecture Decisions

We decided to document all architecture decisions made in this project here. Please use the 
[template](https://github.com/schubmat/DecisionCapture/blob/master/templates/captureTemplate_full.md).
for each decision to document the alternatives and their corresponding positive and negative influences. A short overview and an
explanation to each decision is mandatory!

For **each** decision a new file should be used, named according to the issue and prefixed with the running number. 

Templates are provided by [schubmat](https://github.com/schubmat).
