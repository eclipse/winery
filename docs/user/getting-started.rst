Getting Started
###############

Launching with Docker
*********************

.. note::
   It is recommended that your host or virtual machine has at least 2GB of memory.

Open a command prompt and execute the following command:

.. code-block::

   docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
     -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
     -e WINERY_FEATURE_RADON=true \
     -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER=yaml \
     -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-particles \
     opentosca/winery

Launch a browser: `<http://localhost:8080>`_.

.. note::
   To start Eclipse Winery based on an TOSCA XML repository layout, use the following command:

   .. code-block::

      docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
        -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
        -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/OpenTOSCA/tosca-definitions-public \
        opentosca/winery


Use a custom TOSCA model repository
-----------------------------------

Please follow the next instructions to mount an existing TOSCA model repository into the Eclipse Winery container.
This is useful if you want to save your modeling changes onto your Docker host machine. 

Clone or create git repository on your local filesystem, e.g., by cloning `<https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-particles>`_.

Open a command prompt and execute the following command:

.. warning::
   Replace ``<path_on_your_host>`` with an empty directory path on your host system.

.. code-block::

   docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
     -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
     -e WINERY_FEATURE_RADON=true \
     -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER=yaml \
     -v <path_on_your_host>:/var/repository \
     opentosca/winery

Launch a browser: `<http://localhost:8080>`_.

.. note::
   To start Eclipse Winery based on an TOSCA XML repository layout, use the following command:

   .. code-block::

      docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
        -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
        -v <path_on_your_host>:/var/repository \
        opentosca/winery


Launching with Docker Compose
*****************************

.. note::
   It is recommended that your host or virtual machine has at least 2GB of memory.

Install Docker and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose>`_.

Clone the repository:

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/eclipse/winery
   cd winery/deploy/compose

**[Optional]** Build the Docker image based on your current working copy:
  
.. code-block::

   docker-compose build

**[Optional]** Adapt the Docker Compose configuration to your needs, e.g., to mount a local TOSCA model repository.

Start Winery:

.. code-block::

   docker-compose up

Launch a browser: `<http://localhost:8080>`_.
