Eclipse Winery
##############

Eclipse Winery is a web-based environment to graphically model TOSCA topologies and plans managing these topologies.
The environment includes a type and template management component to offer creation and modification of all elements defined in the TOSCA specification.
All information is stored in a repository, which allows importing and exporting using the TOSCA packaging format.

**Are you tired of maintaining your TOSCA files manually by just using a text editor?**

Use Eclipse Winery as an usability layer on top to maintain your TOSCA files (XML or YAML) in a graphical and intuitive user interface.
Eclipse Winery provides a graphical web-editor with which you can create and maintain all TOSCA entities.
Thereby, Eclipse Winery stores all TOSCA entities in a defined folder structure that fosters the reusability of TOSCA types.
Eclipse Winery validates and stores all TOSCA entities in the syntax defined in the standard.

Further, the graph-based representation of TOSCA topologies in Eclipse Winery provides a quick overview of the entire system and offers a communication basis for the cooperation with other parties.
It therefore offers a quicker introduction to modeling with TOSCA and provides newcomers with necessary guidelines.

This is the main documentation of Eclipse Winery.

Organizational information is provided at the `eclipse.org page <http://eclipse.org/winery>`_.
