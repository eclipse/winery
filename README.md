This is a fork of [Eclipse Winery](https://github.com/eclipse/winery) and might include current research results not yet approved by Eclipse legal.
Find out more about the OpenTOSCA eco system at [www.opentosca.org](http://www.opentosca.org/).

Winery is a web-based environment to graphically model TOSCA topologies and plans managing these topologies.
It is an Eclipse project and thus support is available through its project page <https://eclipse.org/winery>.
Winery is also part of the OpenTOSCA ecosystem where more information is available at <http://www.opentosca.org>.

**The code and the linked libraries are NOT approved by Eclipse Legal.**

There was no software security check of Eclipse Winery in the past.
There might be [remote code execution vulnerabilities](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec). 
Thus, when hosting Eclipse Winery, make it accessible to trustworthy parties only.

## Getting Started

Both development and user documentation is available at <https://eclipse.github.io/winery>.
The source for the documentation can be found in the [docs](docs) directory.

## Differences to Eclipse Winery

The branch `ustutt` differs from eclipse/winery in the following files:

- [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) - extended for USTUTT students
- [README.md](README.md) - This text file + disclaimer
- [LICENSE.spdx](LICENSE.spdx) - Update OpenTOSCA specifics

One can find out the differences between the `ustutt` branch of OpenTOSCA/winery and the `master` branch of eclipse/winery by executing the following command:

    git fetch --all
    git difftool upstream/master origin/ustutt

Precondition:
   
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/eclipse/winery.git
